# osu2midi
It is a python script to convert osu beatmap files (.osu) to midi (.mid).


Does not support changes in tempo throughout the song yet
Slider only have the starting beat, the length of the note will not match the length of the slider. (Same with spinners)

Uses MIDIUtil

The code is poor and there is probably better ways to do it, this is due to me having just started learning my first programming language a day ago
